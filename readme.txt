Dynamically place SVG icons and images on your site via JavaScript-based replacement of HTML placeholders. Similar to how some icon fonts work but without the extra HTTP requests.

== Description ==
This plugin provides a number of icons out-of-the-box that can be enabled and included in a site as SVG markup. Custom SVG icons/images are also supported.

The icons are placed on a page as HTML elements with specific class names which the plugin then replaces with SVG code via JavaScript.

For a full list of built-in SVG icons see [built-in icons](https://mishterk.github.io/dynamic-svg-icons-plugin-for-wordpress/built-in-icons).

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why would I use this over an icon font? =

This approach cuts out the additional requests to load an icon font. It is also easier to register your custom SVG images with this plugin than to load them into an icon font.

= Can I use my own SVG images? =

Yes. See the [_using custom SVGs section_](https://mishterk.github.io/dynamic-svg-icons-plugin-for-wordpress#using-custom-svgs) of the documentation to learn how.
